<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ’•, I'm Mayu</h1>
<h4 align="center">A tech degree's student and a newbie dev!</h3>
<p align="justify">I'm passionate about programming, I discovered it recently because it's really cool how we can solve problems (even those that we ourselves cause with our code, haha), but I admit that I'm just starting out. I'm studying logic, data structures, and venturing into basic front and back-end projects + knowledge that I'm acquiring in college. If you're interested, you can check out some of my projects here, kisses!</p>
